There are two eras of Dictionary development. The first one is pre-dev. In pre-dev, the code was just stored on a local computer. No sharing and no versioning at all.
The second, and current withal, is the dev era. It started when the GitHub repository was created. A branch for every separate program was created.
Since then, most of the programs are versioned in format (alpha / beta)[major].[minor].[build] or (alpha / beta)[major].[minor] usually starting at 1.0 or 1.0.0.
